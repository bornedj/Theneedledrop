# Welcome to the Fantano project
This program uses the youtube api to collect video data from Anthony Fantano's youtube channel "Theneedledrop".
It uses youtube analytics, the video's description, and what was said through the generated closed captions to predict the score that he will give to an album.
Within the video_scrape file, substitute the missing API key for your own, and compile the model to try it out for yourself.
